## Contributions

By contributing to this project you are placing all your code under MIT or less
restricting licenses, and you certify that the code you have used is compatible
with those licenses or is authored by you. If you're doing so on your work time,
you certify that your employer is okay with this.

## Building

The docs use [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook),
[Comprehensive Rust's i18nhelpers](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/tree/main/i18n-helpers),
and the [mdbook-toc plugin](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-toc).
Install both tools with:

```shell
cargo install mdbook mdbook-toc
cargo install --git https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust.git i18n-helpers
```

Then run

```shell
mdbook serve -o
```

to start a web server with the docs. It will open a tab in your browser because
of the ``-o`` flag
