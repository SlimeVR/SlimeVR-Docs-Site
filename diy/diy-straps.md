## Fadetoblk27's

Fadetoblk27 took an approach that does not require sewing of any kind.
This is achieved by using buckles.

## Smeltie's
For Smelties straps the material ELA1300 was used, sadly this material isn't readily available outside of EU and UK neighbouring countries.
This material can be found at LeDuc in Europe and various UK based stores.

These straps require the following materials:
- ELA1300 50mm Elastic band (Can be substituted)
- Velcro strips (Preferably without adhesive)
- 50mm buckles

These straps have one closed end and one open end closed with velcro.
There are no set measurements on how to make these, you will have to tailor these to your own body proportions!
