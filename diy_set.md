## Thank you for purchasing the SlimeVR DIY kit!
To get your DIY set operational, first it will need some additional attention. On this page we will guide you through the basic steps involved into creating your own ready-to-use set of SlimeVR trackers. While this guide contains some general recommendations, feel free to deviate from the norm and make them truly your own! Have fun!

## Introduction
### Box contents
Inside your SlimeVR DIY kit are 7 large SlimeVR Mainboards, 3 small SlimVR Tracker extensions, and 3 Extension cables (1 long, 2 short).

## Designing your case
DIY kits require enclosures to protect them and allow strap attachment. These can be printed, purchased, or crafted.

## Choosing your battery
The SlimeVR Mainboards included in your DIY kit require power from a battery for the best experience. When choosing a battery, we recommend the following specifications:
- Capacity: 1000-1800 mAh
- Voltage: 3.7v
- Connection: Micro JST 1.25mm

The mainboards feature a Micro JST 1.25mm male connector port for attaching a battery. As such, it is best to choose a battery that has a matching female connector. Alternatively, you can solder or crimp these connectors onto a battery for easy attachment to the Mainboard.

## Choosing your straps
You have the option of buying, crafting, and/or customising your straps to your personal preferences. We highly recommend you use elasticised straps with hook and loop fastening, to ensure a comfortable experience and prevent tracker migration.

We recommend the following strap lengths as a baseline guide for choosing your strap design:
Chest and Hip: 100cm
Upper legs (2): 50cm
Lower legs (2) and Arms (2): 35cm
Feet (2): 30cm

*Note: elastic straps stretch, so you may need less than you think!*

The width of your straps you chose are determined by the case you have designed or opted to use. The official cases use 38mm width straps for main trackers, and 25mm width straps for extensions.

The following table of strap sizes used in official SlimeVR sets can be used as a starting reference for purchasing or crafting your own:
