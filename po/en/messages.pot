"1. Before following any of the instructions below, ensure that:\n"
"   - You have at least enough trackers to track your feet (generally 5 "

"   - You have your trackers and headset **on**.\n"
"   - You are wearing your trackers and headset.\n"
"   - Your trackers and headset are connected to the SlimeVR server.\n"
"   - Your trackers and headset are working properly within the SlimeVR "
"server.\n"
"   - Your headset is reporting positional data to the SlimeVR server (this "
"generally means having SteamVR running and connected to SlimeVR using "
"SlimeVR's SteamVR driver).\n"
"2. Navigate to the \"Body Proportions\" tab and ensure you're on \"Automatic "
"calibration\" and not \"Manual calibration\".\n"
"3. Stand up straight and press the **\"Reset all proportions\"** button.\n"
"4. Follow the steps shown on the GUI.\n"
"   - If you're using SlimeVR version 0.6.3 or older, these instructions will "
"be more up-to-date and you can safely ignore the instructions on the GUI. To "
"continue using these instructions on SlimeVR version 0.6.3 or older, you can "
"skip to step 3 \"Get ready to move\" on the GUI.\n"
"5. Make sure to keep your heels on the ground and in the same position for "
"the duration of recording.\n"
"6. Press the **\"Start Recording\"** button, the GUI will indicate that "
"recording has started. The recording will last for approximately 20 "
"seconds.\n"
"7. **Move** until the text on the button changes back to \"Start "
"Recording\", the current best known movements for calibration are as "
"follows, returning to standing up straight after each step:\n"
"   1. Standing up straight, roll your head in a circle.\n"
"   2. Bend your back forwards and squat. While squatting, look to your left, "
"then to your right.\n"
"   3. Twist your upper body to the left (counter-clockwise), then reach down "
"towards the ground.\n"
"   4. Twist your upper body to the right (clockwise), then reach down "
"towards the ground.\n"
"   5. Roll your hips in a circular motion as if you're using a hula hoop.\n"
"   6. If there is time left on the recording, you can repeat these steps "
"until it's finished.\n"
"8. When the recording is done, SlimeVR will process the recording. After "
"processing is done, you will be able to see new values for your body "
"proportions reported in cm.\n"
"9. To use the calculated values, press the **\"They're correct\"** button. "

msgid ""
"AutoBone works by recording movement data and simulating that movement "
"rapidly while gradually adjusting the bone lengths. When adjusting bone "
"lengths, the algorithm measures the amount the feet slide to know whether "
"it's achieving a better or worse outcome with each adjustment. By iterating "
"over the data multiple times, the algorithm is able to obtain reasonable "
"bone length values with minimal foot sliding."
msgstr ""

#: src/server/body-config.md:209
msgid ""
"The AutoBone algorithm uses classic machine learning technique called "
"[hyperparameter optimization][1] to acquire the bone length values. First, "
"many samples of movement data are recorded, then using [hyperparameter "
"optimization][1], the algorithm gradually adjusts the bone lengths to "
"minimize the error of foot sliding. Error is calculated through multiple "
"different methods, but generally it is formulated to retain the headset's "
"reported height, \"average\" human body proportionality, and reduce the "
"amount that the feet slide during movement."

"1. Try completely disabling Windows Defender Firewall on your computer "

"   - If the trackers only show up on SlimeVR when Windows Defender Firewall "

"1. Try pinging the tracker from your computer to see if it can be reached by "
"opening Command Prompt (CMD) and run the command `ping <IP>`, where `<IP>` "
"is your tracker's IP (ex. `ping 192.168.0.1`). You can find the tracker's IP "
"using the \"Serial console\" under the \"Settings\" tab of the SlimeVR GUI.\n"
"   - If the command outputs something like `Reply from 192.168.XXX.XXX: "
"Destination host unreachable.`, then you likely have a problem with either "
"your router or your firewall.\n"
"   - If the command outputs something like `Reply from 192.168.XXX.XXX: "
"bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=63`, then you likely have a problem with either your "
"network adapter or your network settings. You may need to enable broadcast "
"packets (or something similar) on your router, as SlimeVR trackers broadcast "
"to `255.255.255.255` to discover your SlimeVR Server.\n"
"1. Try hosting a Wi-Fi hotspot either from your computer or your phone and "
"connect your trackers to it to see if they will show up on SlimeVR using "
"it.\n"
"   - If the trackers don't show up on SlimeVR, then you likely have a "
"problem with either your trackers or your computer. It may be worth trying "
"disabling your Windows Defender Firewall as per the first step, but using "
"this Wi-Fi hotspot instead.\n"
"   - If the trackers show up on SlimeVR, then you likely have a problem with "
"either your router or the network adapter you connect to your router with."

"IMUs with a magnetometer work like a compass and use the Earths magnetic "
"field as a reference point to eliminate gyroscope drift, however they "
"require a stable magnetic environment or else they will perform erratically. "
"IMUs without a magnetometer don't require a stable magnetic environment, but "

"sensor noise from actual movement and so will slowly spin in the yaw axis "
"over time. For SlimeVR's purposes neither is implicitly better or worse than "

#: src/diy/imu-comparison.md:211

"Often things made of steel or other ferromagnetic materials contribute most "
"to a poor magnetic environment. Some common examples of things that might "
"affect your magnetic environment include, but are not limited to: spring "
"mattresses, radiators, PC cases, desktop speakers, or furniture that's made "
"of steel. In most cases, the effect that these things will have extend about "
"6-12 inches (15-30 cm) and within that range may cause the IMU to rotate "
"incorrectly. The size and amount of mass directly impacts the size of the "
"effected area; a paper clip might only affect your IMU if it's directly next "
"to it, whereas a steel bedframe might affect an area 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) "
"away as previous mentioned. In most cases, depending on the size of your "
"playspace, these issues of certain objects causing interference can be "
"mitigated by avoiding or reposition them. Regardless, other factors such as "
"the wiring or rebar in your building could also affect your magnetic "
"environment. These last few examples are harder to predict and illustrate "
"why it's important to test with an app before assuming you might have a "
"stable magnetic environment."
msgstr ""

"It's also worth mentioning that some controllers have magnets in them, "

"No, but you may still need to reset. When in an area of magnetic "
