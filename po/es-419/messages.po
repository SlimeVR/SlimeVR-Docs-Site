"   1. Standing up straight, roll your head in a circle.\n"

"   6. If there is time left on the recording, you can repeat these steps "
"until it's finished.\n"
"7. When the recording is done, SlimeVR will process the recording. After "
"processing is done, you will be able to see new values for your body "
"proportions reported in cm.\n"
"8. To use the calculated values, press the **\"They're correct\"** button. If "

"AutoBone works by recording movement data and simulating that movement "
"rapidly while gradually adjusting the bone lengths. When adjusting bone "
"lengths, the algorithm measures the amount the feet slide to know whether "
"it's achieving a better or worse outcome with each adjustment. By iterating "

"length values with minimal foot sliding."
msgstr ""

#: src/server/body-config.md:124
msgid ""
"The AutoBone algorithm uses classic machine learning technique called "
"[hyperparameter optimization][1] to acquire the bone length values. First, "
"many samples of movement data are recorded, then using [hyperparameter "
"optimization][1], the algorithm gradually adjusts the bone lengths to "
"minimize the error of foot sliding. Error is calculated through multiple "
"different methods, but generally it is formulated to retain the headset's "
"reported height, \"average\" human body proportionality, and reduce the "
"amount that the feet slide during movement."

"1. Try completely disabling Windows Defender Firewall on your computer "

"1. Try pinging the tracker from your computer to see if it can be reached by "

"your tracker's IP (ex. `ping 192.168.0.1`). You can find the tracker's IP "
"using the \"Serial console\" under the \"Settings\" tab of the SlimeVR GUI.\n"
"   - If the command outputs something like `Reply from 192.168.XXX.XXX: "
"Destination host unreachable.`, then you likely have a problem with either "
"your router or your firewall.\n"
"   - If the command outputs something like `Reply from 192.168.XXX.XXX: "
"bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=63`, then you likely have a problem with either your "
"network adapter or your network settings. You may need to enable broadcast "
"packets (or something similar) on your router, as SlimeVR trackers broadcast "
"to `255.255.255.255` to discover your SlimeVR Server.\n"
"1. Try hosting a Wi-Fi hotspot either from your computer or your phone and "
"connect your trackers to it to see if they will show up on SlimeVR using it.\n"
"   - If the trackers don't show up on SlimeVR, then you likely have a problem "
"with either your trackers or your computer. It may be worth trying disabling "
"your Windows Defender Firewall as per the first step, but using this Wi-Fi "
"hotspot instead.\n"

"particular is to use a GoPro chest mount, which can improve stability greatly "
"if you find your chest trackers tend to slide. Also, its worth mentioning "
"that you may want different sized straps depending on where each tracker is "
"going to go, such as having shorter straps for thigh trackers than ankle "
"trackers. Be sure to measure yourself with a tape measure if you're going to "
"go this route! It's worth noting that *elastic stretches* so if you find "

msgstr ""

"Often things made of steel or other ferromagnetic materials contribute most "
"to a poor magnetic environment. Some common examples of things that might "
"affect your magnetic environment include, but are not limited to: spring "
"mattresses, radiators, PC cases, desktop speakers, or furniture that's made "
"of steel. In most cases, the effect that these things will have extend about "
"6-12 inches (15-30 cm) and within that range may cause the IMU to rotate "
"incorrectly. The size and amount of mass directly impacts the size of the "
"effected area; a paper clip might only affect your IMU if it's directly next "
"to it, whereas a steel bedframe might affect an area 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) "
"away as previous mentioned. In most cases, depending on the size of your "
"playspace, these issues of certain objects causing interference can be "
"mitigated by avoiding or reposition them. Regardless, other factors such as "
"the wiring or rebar in your building could also affect your magnetic "
"environment. These last few examples are harder to predict and illustrate why "
"it's important to test with an app before assuming you might have a stable "
"magnetic environment."
msgstr ""

#: src/diy/imu-comparison.md:210

"It's also worth mentioning that some controllers have magnets in them, either "
"to hold the battery door closed or for the trigger. As such, placing your "

msgstr ""

#: src/diy/imu-comparison.md:214
msgid ""
"No, but you may still need to reset. When in an area of magnetic interference "
"an IMU with a magnetometer will reorient itself the same way a compass will "
"when put near a magnet; if you take the magnet away from the compass, the "
"compass will return pointing towards magnetic North. As mentioned though, you "
"may still find yourself needing to reset. For instance, if your bed has a "
"steel bedframe you'll likely need to perform a reset so that your trackers "
"are facing the correct direction. If you then move somewhere else within your "
"playspace you'll likely then need to reset once again."
