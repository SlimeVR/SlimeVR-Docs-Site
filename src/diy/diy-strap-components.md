```admonish important
For information on existing community designs for WiFi Slime straps refer to [Community DIY Straps](./community-diy-straps.md), and [Smol Community Straps](../smol-slimes/hardware/smol-slimes-community-straps.md) for [Smols](../smol-slimes/index.md) straps.
```

Key differences affecting WiFi Slimes and Smol Slimes strap designs:

## Strap Parts

## 🎗️ Band

### Band Materials

#### Elastic Band with Non-Slip Webbing

<img src="./assets/img/diy-straps/components/Depact Elastic Band With Non-slip Webbing.webp" loading="lazy" class="small-size-image" alt="Depact's Elastic Band with Non-Slip Webbing"/>

The foundation of most entry level DIY straps.

This elastic band with integrated non-slip silicone webbing provides better grip against skin compared to standard elastic and nylon, reducing tracker rotation and drift during movement.

Can be found by searching: `Elastic Band With Non-slip Webbing`.

### Measuring Band Length for Making Straps

##### What You Need
- Soft measuring tape  

##### 1. Measure Placement Areas
Wrap the band **snug, not tight** around each [spot of tracker placement](#tracker-placement). Keep the band flat and level.

##### 2. Add Allowance
Add **10 cm** to each measurement. You can always cut down.

Some of the added length is needed to hold strap in place by buckles and slides.

##### 3. Final Check
Bands should:
- Stay secure during movement.
- Not restrict circulation.
- Have **5 cm** of adjustment.

**Example:**  
5 meters of elastic band are generally enough to make 6 straps for an average man wearing European size XL.

## 🔒 Buckle

### Buckle Tier Rankings

Ranking criteria:
- Ease of opening and closing on limb blindly - can you easily close it on limb without looking?
- Comfort while standing - does it dig in or feel bulky?
- Comfort while laying on it - Do you feel it while lying on it?
- Friction for band fragment it holds - does the band slip through?
- Tactile markers to help prevent twisted band locking, by telling where top and bottom is - can you orient it correctly by touch, when closing it?

## ↔️ Slide

### Tri-glide Slide, a.k.a. Webbing Slide

A small but essential component for adjustable straps. This simple device consists of a rectangle with a dividing bar, creating two openings. The band threads through one opening and back through the other, allowing you to adjust strap tightness without sewing. Works best in combination with a primary buckle for maximum security.

### Slide Tier Rankings

Ranking criteria:
- Comfort while standing - minimal bulk and pinching.
- Comfort while laying on it - smooth surface without sharp edges.
- Friction for band band it holds - secure grip without slipping.

## 🖨️ Buckles and Slides Printing Material

### 🟢 Best Performance

#### 🟢 PETG
- **Strength**: Good impact resistance, less brittle than PLA
- **Durability**: Holds up well to repeated use and sweat exposure
- **Print Settings**: Print as hot as the filament can handle (typically higher temps). Use high heat with slow cooling for strongest results. Reserve cooling for bridges and support interfaces only. Lower print speeds yield even better results.
- **Issues**: Stringing is caused by wet filament and insufficient retraction settings, not by lack of cooling
- **Availability**: One of the widely available FDM 3D printing materials

### 🔴 Breaks Apart from Active Usage over Time

**Not recommended:** These materials are acceptable to use if no other option is available. They have issues with properties critical for printing parts that work and last.

#### 🔴 PLA+/PLA Pro
- **Strength**: Better than standard PLA
- **Durability**:🔴 Moderate; can crack under repeated stress
- **Friction**: Higher friction than PETG, slides may stick
- **Issues**: Brittle, heat sensitivity (hot rooms/sunlight)

#### 🔴 Standard PLA
- **Strength**: Weakest option, prone to snapping
- **Durability**: 🔴 Poor for functional parts with repeated use, better not use
- **Friction**: Can work for slides but wears faster
- **Issues**: Brittle, especially in thin sections. Very bad for smol cases
- **Availability**: One of the most available FDM 3D printing materials
- **Best for**: Testing fit before printing in better material

## Strap Sliding Troubleshooting

Straps slipping is one of the most common issues when making your own straps. This causes trackers to move and rotate, degrading tracking accuracy. For good tracking it is critical for your straps to not slide.

There are a few things you can try to prevent or minimize this issue.

Things to check:
- Material that is too flexible-stiffer materials with more grip resist sliding better.
- Your straps are too narrow/small. Wider straps distribute pressure more evenly and slide less.

Ideas:
- Add a few lines of hot glue on the strap for added grip on the skin-facing side.
- Use secondary straps to keep the trackers in place (like [Tom Yum's design](./community-diy-straps.md#tom-yums)).
