# Official DIY Clone Trackers

Due to the nature of SlimeVR being open-source it is entirely possible to create your own trackers based on the official design files.
Especially now that the [SlimeVR Store](https://shop.slimevr.dev) started selling components such as: cases, cables and IMUs!

## Soldering the IMU to the main PCB
The soldering process for official slimes is a little different than your usual DIY slimes. Where normally DIY slimes are soldered together with through hole wiring, SlimeVR on the other hand uses castelated edges. This makes soldering the IMU very fast and efficient.

What do you need to solder the IMU to the main PCB?
- Soldering iron.
- Leadfree Solder.
- Chisel style soldering tip (optional).
- Assembly jig (optional).

## Flashing the firmware
To flash the firmware you will need:
- USB-C cable with data pins (official SlimeVR cable is recommended).
- Paperclip or tweezers to bridge a connection on the back.

## Final Assembly  
For final assembly we would like to refer to the official SlimeVR repair guide. This contains information regarding both assembly and dissasembly. On an additional note, the sticky foam pad usually sits on the printed side of the battery (in the case of production units).
