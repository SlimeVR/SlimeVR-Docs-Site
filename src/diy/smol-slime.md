# Smol Slime
Smol Slimes (also known as nRF Trackers) uses a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductor nRF52x and nRF52840 System-on-Chip (SoC). These are very power-efficient trackers, requiring a much smaller battery that can last for days to weeks compared to traditional ESP (WiFi) SlimeVR Trackers. A Receiver (also known as a dongle) is required to bridge the communications between the trackers and SlimeVR Server. This method doesn't work with Quest Standalone without using a computer for OSC.

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of SlimeVR Server and will require a firmware update. Nothing is final yet; this includes hardware, firmware, protocols used, and etc.

## Hardware

### Receiver
* **eByte Dongle (E104-BT5040U)** - Cheapest Receiver, free shipping from AliExpress, and has PCB Trace Antenna.
* **Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059)** - More expensive, not free shipping from Digikey/Mouser, and has PCB Trace Antenna.
* **SuperMini nRF52840** - Cheapest option, but having a ceramic antenna and your trackers also having a ceramic antenna will reduce signal strength and range.
* **Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840** - Expensive option, but having a ceramic antenna and your trackers also having a ceramic antenna will reduce signal strength and range.

### Tracker
* **SuperMini nRF52840** (Cheapest) or **Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840** (Smaller, but very expensive)
* Compatible **Inertial Measurement Unit/IMU Breakout Board**
    * BMI270 (IMU Wake on Motion Unfinished)
    * ICM-42688-P
    * ICM-42688-V
    * ICM-45686
    * ISM330BX
    * ISM330DHCX
    * LSM6DSO
    * LSM6DSR
    * LSM6DSV
    * LSM6DSV16B
* Compatible **Magnetometer** (Optional)
    * AK09940
    * BMM150 (Not Tested)
    * BMM350 (Not Tested)
    * IIS2MDC
    * IST8306
    * IST8308
    * LIS2MDL
    * LIS3MDL (Not Tested)
    * MMC5983MA
* **Push Button/Momentary Switch** (One is recommended for Resetting, Pairing, Calibration, Sleep, putting the tracker in DFU mode for firmware. A second can be used to separate the original Reset functions from the other features.) A tweezer can be used to short the pins for the initial tracker setup instead.
* **Slide Switch** - Recommended, but optional. Allowing you to turn on/off your tracker. Deep sleep by holding down the push button puts the tracker in a very low power state (not completely off).
* **3.7V LiPo Battery** - Battery must be 50ma or larger with XIAO nRF52840 and 100ma or larger with SuperMini nRF52840.

## Firmware
```admonish important
The recommended method of getting the firmware is in the pre-compiled section if you don't need custom config or pin defines.
```

### Cloning Repositories
1. Open Command Prompt (Type ```cmd``` in Start Menu).
1. Change to a directory you want the repositories to clone to. (Use "cd" followed by space and then a full path to a folder or drive.)
1. Cloning SlimeNRF Receiver Repository.
```
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF-Receiver.git
```
4. Cloning SlimeNRF Tracker Repository.
```
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF.git
```
**Note:** It is recommended to clone to a filepath without whitespaces and/or unicode characters. You may encounters errors when building the firmware.

### Building firmware
1. Launch VS Code using nRF Connect's Toolchain Manager.
1. Open the folder to one of the repositories.
1. Make any pin changes or necessary adjustments to `board\arm followed by board_name*board_name*.dts`.
1. Click on the nRF Connect tab on the left side of your screen (about half way down).
1. Under "Applications" , click on "+ Add build configuration."
1. For Receiver, under "CMake Preset", select the board and then scroll to the bottom and "Build Configuration". For Tracker, under "Board Target", select the "Custom" Radio button first, then select the board, and scroll to the bottom to "Build Configuration."

**Note:** For trackers, settings are found in "nRF Kconfig GUI" under "Actions" and expand the "SlimeNRF" section.

### Changing board defines
Board defines can be found in ```\boards\``` for overlays (Boards within the Zephyr library) and custom boards are found in ```\boards\arm\BOARD_NAME\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Navigate to the board's .dts file.
1. I2C (SCL/SDA) can be changed to other pins. Make sure you are using "High Frequency" pins and that you change the pins for both lines.
1. SW0 can be enabled by uncommenting (removing the ```// ```) from lines below the description commment. You can select the lines and press **Ctrl /** if you are using VS Code. Re-define the gpio pin if necessary.
1. INT (int0-gpios) can be re-defined under the Zephyr user section.
1. CLK (clk-gpios) can be uncommented and re-defined if you are using an IMU with an external clock/crystal oscillator such as the ICM-42688 or ICM-45686.

### Adjusting settings in the Kconfig
1. Go to the nRF Connect tab of VS Code.
1. Build the desired board once.
1. A section called **Actions** should appear on the left navigation board.
1. Select your built board under **Applications**, then scroll down to the **Actions**.
1. Double click **nRF Kconfig GUI**.
1. Scroll down to the **SlimeNRF** section.
1. Enable/Disable or adjust any configs needed.
1. Click the "Apply" button", then click the "Save to file" button.
1. If prompted which file to save to, select **prj.conf**.
1. Click on the "Pristine Build" button next to **Build** in the **Actions** section.

#### SuperMini and other Devices with Adafruit Bootloader as Receiver/Tracker (Make sure Bootloader is updated first!):
1. Plug the device into your computer via data USB cable.
1. The device should start off in DFU mode when new without a bootloader. The LED should be fading on and off.
1. If device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or short RST/GND pins) twice within 0.5s. If device with existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset 4 times.
1. Navigate to your local Receiver or Tracker repository, then go to `build\zephyr\`.
