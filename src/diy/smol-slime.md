# Smol Slime
Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, uses a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC). These are very power-efficient trackers, requiring a much smaller battery that can last for days to weeks compared to traditional ESP (WiFi) SlimeVR Trackers. A Receiver, or dongle, is required to bridge communication between trackers and the SlimeVR Server. This method does not work with Quest Standalone without using a computer for OSC.

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of SlimeVR Server and may require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final yet; this includes hardware, firmware, protocols used, etc.
