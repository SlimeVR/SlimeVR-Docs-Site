# Smol Slime
Smol Slimes (also known as nRF Trackers) uses a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductor nRF52x and nRF52840 System-on-Chip (SoC). These are very power-efficient trackers, requiring a much smaller battery that can last for days to weeks compared to traditional ESP (WiFi) SlimeVR Trackers. A Receiver (also known as a dongle) is required to bridge the communications between the trackers and SlimeVR Server. This method doesn't work with Quest Standalone without using a computer for OSC.

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of SlimeVR Server and will require a firmware update. Nothing is final yet; this includes hardware, firmware, protocols used, and etc.

### üì° Receiver

#### Dongles with PCB antenna
Those receivers have a built-in fairy optimized PCB antenna. It is easier to use a USB extender cable to get better signal strength than to modify the antenna.

| Name                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| eByte Dongle (E104-BT5040U)                     | Cheapest Receiver, free shipping from AliExpress, and has PCB Trace Antenna. <br /> Sold on Alibaba by `Chengdu Ebyte Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.` <br/> - `E104-BT5040U` is compatible with all the programs of Nordic's original nRF52840 USB Dongle, and IO ports and hardware resources. <br/> - `E104-BT5040UA` is not usable as receiver because it's built to capture BLE4.2 and BLE5.0 protocol packets only. |
| Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059) | More expensive, not free shipping from Digikey/Mouser, and has PCB Trace Antenna.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Microcontrollers with no PCB antenna
Those microcontrollers can work as receivers, but their built-in antennas are too weak. To improve signal strength, you can attach a 31 cm wire to the antenna, making up for the lack of a PCB antenna.

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SuperMini nRF52840         | Cheapest option, but having a ceramic antenna and your trackers also having a ceramic antenna will reduce signal strength and range. | When used as a receiver, signal strength can be improved by adding a 31cm wire to the antenna. The stock antenna is insufficient for receiver.
| Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 | Expensive option, but smaller.                                                                                                       |

| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ICM-45686](imu-comparison.md#ICM-45686) + IST8306 | More expensive and accurate option. In theory should drift less over time. | [store.kouno.xyz](https://store.kouno.xyz/products/icm-45686-ist8306-module) |
| LSM6DSR + IST8306                                  | Cheaper, in theory more prone to drift, but very solid option.             | [store.kouno.xyz](https://store.kouno.xyz/products/lsm6dsr-ist8306-module)   |

### Push Button/Momentary Switch 
One is recommended for Resetting, Pairing, Calibration, Sleep, putting the tracker in DFU mode for firmware. 

A second can be used to separate the original Reset functions from the other features.

A tweezer can be used to short the pins for the initial tracker setup instead.
### Slide Switch (Recommended, but optional)
Allowing you to turn on/off your tracker. Deep sleep by holding down the push button puts the tracker in a very low power state (not completely off).
### 3.7V LiPo Battery
Battery must be 50ma or larger with XIAO nRF52840 and 100ma or larger with SuperMini nRF52840.

## Firmware
```admonish important
The recommended method of getting the firmware is in the [pre-compiled section](#pre-compiled-firmware-for-default-pins) if you don't need custom config or pin defines.
```

### Cloning Repositories
1. Open Command Prompt (Type ```cmd``` in Start Menu).
1. Change to a directory you want the repositories to clone to. (Use "cd" followed by space and then a full path to a folder or drive.)
1. Cloning SlimeNRF Receiver Repository.
```
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF-Receiver.git
```
4. Cloning SlimeNRF Tracker Repository.
```
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF.git
```
**Note:** It is recommended to clone to a filepath without whitespaces and/or unicode characters. You may encounters errors when building the firmware.

### Building firmware
1. Launch VS Code using nRF Connect's Toolchain Manager.
1. Open the folder to one of the repositories.
1. Make any pin changes or necessary adjustments to ```boards\MANUFACTURER\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Click on the nRF Connect tab on the left side of your screen (about half way down).
1. Under "Applications" , click on "+ Add build configuration."
1. Select preset from "Board Target".
1. Scroll down and click on the "Build Configuration" button.

**Note:** For trackers, settings are found in "nRF Kconfig GUI" under "Actions" and expand the "SlimeNRF" section.

#### Changing board defines
Board defines can be found in ```\boards\``` for overlays (Boards within the Zephyr library) and custom boards are found in ```boards\MANUFACTURER\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Navigate to the board's .dts file.
1. I2C (SCL/SDA) can be changed to other pins. Make sure you are using "High Frequency" pins and that you change the pins for both lines.
1. SW0 can be enabled by uncommenting (removing the ```// ```) from lines below the description commment. You can select the lines and press **Ctrl /** if you are using VS Code. Re-define the gpio pin if necessary.
1. INT (int0-gpios) can be re-defined under the Zephyr user section.
1. CLK (clk-gpios) can be uncommented and re-defined if you are using an IMU with an external clock/crystal oscillator such as the ICM-42688 or ICM-45686.

#### Adjusting settings in the Kconfig
1. Go to the nRF Connect tab of VS Code.
1. Build the desired board once.
1. A section called **Actions** should appear on the left navigation board.
1. Select your built board under **Applications**, then scroll down to the **Actions**.
1. Double click **nRF Kconfig GUI**.
1. Scroll down to the **SlimeNRF** section.
1. Enable/Disable or adjust any configs needed.
1. Click the "Apply" button", then click the "Save to file" button.
1. If prompted which file to save to, select **prj.conf**.
1. Click on the "Pristine Build" button next to **Build** in the **Actions** section.

1. For SuperMini, download ```update-nice_nano_bootloader-x.x.x_nosd.uf2```. For XIAO, download ```update-xiao_nrf52840_ble_sense_bootloader-x.x.x_nosd.uf2```. (The proper non-Sense version doesn't update the bootloader.)
1. Plug the device into your computer via data USB cable.
1. The device should start off in DFU mode when new without a bootloader. The LED should be fading on and off.
1. If device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or short RST/GND pins) twice within 0.5s. If device with existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset 4 times.
1. Navigate to your Downloads folder and copy the uf2 file.
1. Navigate to the Mass Storage Drive (ex. NICENANO/XIAO-SENSE) from ThisPC.
1. Paste the file into there, and the window should close and the device will reboot.

### Flashing firmware to device
```admonish important
Update the bootloader to your SuperMini and XIAO boards before flashing firmware; there is a very high chance that you will brick your device otherwise. eByte and Nordic dongles don't fall in this category.
```

#### Dongles (eByte/Nordic)
1. Open "Programmer" in nRF Connect.
1. Press the reset button, and the LED should start fading on and off, putting the device in DFU Mode. For eByte, it is the right button. For Nordic, it is a side button (not the round white button).
1. On the top left corner, select your Device.
1. Click on "Add File".
1. Navigate to your local Receiver repository, then select file in ```build\REPOSITORY_NAME\zephyr\zephyr.hex```.
1. Click the "Write button".

#### SuperMini and other Devices with Adafruit Bootloader as Receiver/Tracker:
1. Plug the device into your computer via data USB cable.
1. The device should start off in DFU mode when new without a bootloader. The LED should be fading on and off.
1. If device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or short RST/GND pins) twice within 0.5s. If device with existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset 4 times.
1. Navigate to your local Receiver or Tracker repository, then go to ```build\REPOSITORY_NAME\zephyr\```.
1. Copy zephyr.uf2 file.
1. Navigate to the Mass Storage Drive (ex. NICENANO/XIAO-SENSE) from ThisPC.
1. Paste the file into there and the window should close and device will reboot.
