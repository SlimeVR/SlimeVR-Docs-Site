# Smol Slime
Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, uses a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC). These are very power-efficient trackers, requiring a much smaller battery that can last for days to weeks compared to traditional ESP (WiFi) SlimeVR Trackers. A Receiver, or dongle, is required to bridge communication between trackers and the SlimeVR Server. This method does not work with Quest Standalone without using a computer for OSC.

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of SlimeVR Server and may require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final yet; this includes hardware, firmware, protocols used, etc.

## üì° Receiver Hardware
It is important to use boards with a good antenna to maintain signal integrity and range. Hardware with PCB antennas are generally the best option to use as a receiver.

### USB Dongles
These dongles have a fairly optimized PCB antenna. If you have issues with signal integrity, it is recommended to use a USB extension cable.

### Microcontroller Boards
These boards use antenna designs that are not optimized for range. If you are using the same boards for both trackers and receiver, they will likely perform poorly without modification.

## üèÉ Tracker Hardware
Before you start, decide on [how many trackers you may need](../slimevr101.md#how-many-trackers-do-you-need).

Trackers are required to have a battery and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). A magnetometer is optional.

Buttons and slide switches are recommended but not required. Buttons can be added to control the tracker, and a slide switch can be used to physically disconnect a tracker's battery.

### Sensor Modules

#### IMU Modules
Some of the supported sensor modules are described on the [IMU Comparison page](imu-comparison.md). Note that most common sensor modules are not supported.

#### IMU + Magnetometer Modules
Meia, a member of the [SlimeVR Discord](#discord), produces and sells sensor modules with an onboard magnetometer. They are compatible with common sensor modules, and the form factor is suitable for stacked builds.

### Buttons
Push buttons/momentary switches are used to control the tracker. Multiple button configurations are supported. A tracker can have either a reset button, a user button, or both.

The reset button is suitable for all functionality. If a user button is available, it will be used instead.

If a button is not available, tweezers can be used to short the pins for initial tracker setup.

### Switches
A slide switch can be used to physically disconnect a battery. Some boards have a high standby power draw and will require a switch.

If a switch is not used, a tracker can enter deep sleep by holding down the user button.

### Batteries
Most boards will support a 3.7V Li-ion/LiPo battery. Usually, batteries have a maximum charge rate of 1C, or a 1 hour charge rate. Do not use a battery if the charge rating will be exceeded.

To extend the lifespan of the battery, a much lower charge rate close to 0.5C is recommended.

## Firmware
```admonish important
The recommended method of getting the firmware is in the [pre-compiled section](#pre-compiled-firmware-for-default-pins) if you don't need custom config or pin defines.
```

### Cloning Repositories
1. Open Command Prompt (Type ```cmd``` in Start Menu).
1. Change to a directory you want the repositories to clone to. (Use "cd" followed by space and then a full path to a folder or drive.)
1. Cloning SlimeNRF Receiver Repository.
```
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF-Receiver.git
```
4. Cloning SlimeNRF Tracker Repository.
```
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF.git
```
**Note:** It is recommended to clone to a filepath without whitespaces and/or unicode characters. You may encounters errors when building the firmware.

### Building firmware
1. Launch VS Code using nRF Connect's Toolchain Manager.
1. Open the folder to one of the repositories.
1. Make any pin changes or necessary adjustments to ```boards\MANUFACTURER\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Click on the nRF Connect tab on the left side of your screen (about half way down).
1. Under "Applications" , click on "+ Add build configuration."
1. Select preset from "Board Target".
1. Scroll down and click on the "Build Configuration" button.

**Note:** For trackers, settings are found in "nRF Kconfig GUI" under "Actions" and expand the "SlimeNRF" section.

#### Changing board defines
Board defines can be found in ```\boards\``` for overlays (Boards within the Zephyr library) and custom boards are found in ```boards\MANUFACTURER\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Navigate to the board's .dts file.
1. I2C (SCL/SDA) can be changed to other pins. Make sure you are using "High Frequency" pins and that you change the pins for both lines.
1. SW0 can be enabled by uncommenting (removing the ```// ```) from lines below the description commment. You can select the lines and press **Ctrl /** if you are using VS Code. Re-define the gpio pin if necessary.
1. INT (int0-gpios) can be re-defined under the Zephyr user section.
1. CLK (clk-gpios) can be uncommented and re-defined if you are using an IMU with an external clock/crystal oscillator such as the ICM-42688 or ICM-45686.

#### Adjusting settings in the Kconfig
1. Go to the nRF Connect tab of VS Code.
1. Build the desired board once.
1. A section called **Actions** should appear on the left navigation board.
1. Select your built board under **Applications**, then scroll down to the **Actions**.
1. Double click **nRF Kconfig GUI**.
1. Scroll down to the **SlimeNRF** section.
1. Enable/Disable or adjust any configs needed.
1. Click the "Apply" button", then click the "Save to file" button.
1. If prompted which file to save to, select **prj.conf**.
1. Click on the "Pristine Build" button next to **Build** in the **Actions** section.

### Updating Adafruit Bootloader (SuperMini / XIAO)
1. You can download them here. <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases</a>
1. For SuperMini, download ```update-nice_nano_bootloader-x.x.x_nosd.uf2```. For XIAO, download ```update-xiao_nrf52840_ble_sense_bootloader-x.x.x_nosd.uf2```. (The proper non-Sense version doesn't update the bootloader.)
1. Plug the device into your computer via data USB cable.
1. The device should start off in DFU mode when new without a bootloader. The LED should be fading on and off.
1. If device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or short RST/GND pins) twice within 0.5s. If device with existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset 4 times.
1. Navigate to your Downloads folder and copy the uf2 file.
1. Navigate to the Mass Storage Drive (ex. NICENANO/XIAO-SENSE) from ThisPC.
1. Paste the file into there, and the window should close and the device will reboot.

### Flashing firmware to device
```admonish important
Update the bootloader to your SuperMini and XIAO boards before flashing firmware; there is a very high chance that you will brick your device otherwise. eByte and Nordic dongles don't fall in this category.
```

#### Dongles (eByte/Nordic)
1. Open "Programmer" in nRF Connect.
1. Press the reset button, and the LED should start fading on and off, putting the device in DFU Mode. For eByte, it is the right button. For Nordic, it is a side button (not the round white button).
1. On the top left corner, select your Device.
1. Click on "Add File".
1. Navigate to your local Receiver repository, then select file in ```build\REPOSITORY_NAME\zephyr\zephyr.hex```.
1. Click the "Write button".

#### SuperMini and other Devices with Adafruit Bootloader as Receiver/Tracker:
1. Plug the device into your computer via data USB cable.
1. The device should start off in DFU mode when new without a bootloader. The LED should be fading on and off.
1. If device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or short RST/GND pins) twice within 0.5s. If device with existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset 4 times.
1. Navigate to your local Receiver or Tracker repository, then go to ```build\REPOSITORY_NAME\zephyr\```.
1. Copy zephyr.uf2 file.
1. Navigate to the Mass Storage Drive (ex. NICENANO/XIAO-SENSE) from ThisPC.
1. Paste the file into there and the window should close and device will reboot.

### Pairing Mode
