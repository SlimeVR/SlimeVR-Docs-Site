# Smol Slime
```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of SlimeVR Server and may require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final at this stage; this includes hardware, firmware, protocols used, etc.
```

Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, use a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC). These are very power-efficient trackers, requiring a much smaller battery that can last for days to weeks compared to traditional ESP (WiFi) SlimeVR Trackers. A receiver, or dongle, is required to bridge communication between trackers and the SlimeVR Server. This method does not work with Quest Standalone without using a computer for OSC.

```admonish note
Welcome traveler. If you new and feeling lost - I would suggest to go through [Smol Community Builds](smol-slimes/smol-slimes-community-builds.md) to get examples of finished projects. Community cases pages frequently include list of parts you can use to make your life easier.

Then you can explore [Smol Hardware](smol-slimes/smol-hardware.md) to consider alternative parts.

If you use one of existing case designs you likely don't have to worry about firmware and just pick one of prebuilt firmware, but you also can built your own. Page about this: [Smol Firmware](smol-slimes/smol-firmware.md).
