### Cloning Repositories
1. Open the Command Prompt by typing ```cmd``` in the Start Menu.
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repositories.. (Type "cd" followed by a space and then the full path to the desired folder or drive.)
1. Cloning SlimeNRF Receiver Repository.
```bash
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF-Receiver.git
```
4. Cloning the SlimeNRF Tracker Repository.
```bash
git clone --single-branch --recurse-submodules -b master https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF.git
```

If you're using an existing case design, you can opt for prebuilt firmware; otherwise, build your own. See Smol Firmware for more details.

**Note:** It is recommended to clone to a file path that does not contain whitespace or Unicode characters. You may encounter errors when building the firmware.

### Building Firmware using nRF Connect for VS Code
```admonish important
***Bug Fix for Zephyr 2.9.0***

1. Open ```C:\ncs\v2.9.0\zephyr\drivers\retained_mem\retained_mem_nrf_ram_ctrl.c``` in your preferred code editor.
1. Add a comma at the end of Line 15.
1. Save the file.
<img src="../../assets/img/zephyr290_fix.png" alt="Zephyr 2.9.0 bug fix">
```

1. Launch VS Code using the nRF Connect's Toolchain Manager.
1. Open the folder for one of the repositories.
1. Make any pin changes or necessary adjustments to ```boards\MANUFACTURER\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Click on the nRF Connect tab located on the left side of your screen, approximately halfway down.
1. Under "Applications" , click on "+ Add build configuration."
1. Select a preset from the "Board Target".
1. Scroll down and click the "Build Configuration" button.

**Note:** For trackers, settings can be found in the "nRF Kconfig GUI" under "Actions" and expand the "SlimeNRF" section.

#### Changing Board Defines
Board defines can be found in ```\boards\``` for overlays (Boards within the Zephyr library), while custom boards are located in ```boards\MANUFACTURER\BOARD_NAME.dts```.
1. Navigate to the board's .dts file.
1. The I2C (SCL/SDA) lines can be assigned to different pins. Ensure that you are using "High Frequency" pins and that you change the pins for both lines accordingly.
1. SW0 can be ‚úÖ by uncommenting (removing the ```// ```) from the lines below the description comment. If you are using VS Code, you can select the lines and press **Ctrl /** if you are using VS Code. Additionally, redefine the GPIO pin if necessary.
1. The INT (int0-gpios) can be redefined in the Zephyr user section.
1. The CLK (clk-gpios) can be uncommented and redefined if you are using an IMU with an external clock or crystal oscillator, such as the ICM-42688 or ICM-45686.

#### Adjusting settings in the Kconfig
1. Navigate to the nRF Connect tab of VS Code.
1. Build the desired board once.
1. A section titled **Actions** should be displayed on the left navigation panel.
1. Select your built board under **Applications**, then scroll down to the **Actions** section.
1. Double-click **nRF Kconfig GUI**.
1. Scroll down to the **SlimeNRF** section.
1. Enable or disable any necessary configurations, or adjust them as needed.
1. Click the "Apply" button, then click the "Save to File" button.
1. If prompted to select a file to save, choose **prj.conf**.
1. Click the "Pristine Build" button located next to **Build** in the **Actions** section.

### Building Firmware Manually (Linux)
This is only recommended if you are experiencing issues with nRF Connect for Desktops Toolchain Manager or nRF Connect for VS Code, as you will need to manually set up the toolchain.

#### Setup Python Venv
Using a virtual environment (venv) will keep all build tools for Zephyr, such as `west`, contained. <br>
`python3 -m venv ~/.venv/nrf52` <br>
`source ~/.venv/nrf52/bin/activate` (Run the setup whenever you use or modify it.) <br>
`pip3 install west`

#### Setup nRF Connect SDK code
Please select an appropriate folder for installing the toolchain, such as `~/.toolchain-nrf52`. <br>
Then execute: <br>
`west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr v2.9.0 nrf52-sdk-2.9.0` <br>
`cd nrf52-sdk-2.9.0` <br>
`west update` (This will download dozens of Git repositories; it may take some time.) <br>
`pip install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements-base.txt` (Install the remaining requirements for building.) <br>
`west zephyr-export` (This will register the necessary CMake files in your home directory.) <br>
If you move this folder, you simply need to re-run the last command.

#### Setup Zephyr SDK
The nRF Connect SDK depends on the Zephyr SDK, so please return to your toolchain folder (e.g. `~/.toolchain-nrf52`) to install it: <br>
`wget -q https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.17.0/zephyr-sdk-0.17.0_linux-x86_64_minimal.tar.xz` <br>
`tar xf zephyr-sdk-0.17.0_linux-x86_64_minimal.tar.xz -C .` <br>
`cd zephyr-sdk-0.17.0` <br>
`./setup.sh -c -t arm-zephyr-eabi` (This will register the necessary CMake files in your home directory.) <br>
If you move this folder, you simply need to re-run the last command.

#### Compiling Manually
Assuming your toolchain is installed in `~/.toolchain-nrf52` and you are in the firmware directory:
``` sh
source ~/.venv/nrf52/bin/activate
source ~/.toolchain-nrf52/nrf52-sdk-2.9.0/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh
west build --board BOARD --build-dir build . -- -DNCS_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=NONE -DBOARD_ROOT=.
```
Replace BOARD with your specific board (e.g. `supermini_uf2/nrf52840` for the SuperMini, `nrf52840dongle/nrf52840` for a dongle receiver). <br>
The compiled firmware will be located at `PROJECT_DIR/build/PROJECT_DIR/zephyr/zephyr[.hex|.uf2]`.

#### Compiling with VS Code (Without Extensions)
Assuming your toolchain is installed in `~/.toolchain-nrf52`, use the following tasks, which should be placed in `.vscode/tasks.json`:
``` JSON
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build",
            "type": "shell",
            "group": "build",
            "command": "source",
            "args": [
                "~/.venv/nrf52/bin/activate", "&&",
                "source", "~/.toolchain-nrf52/nrf52-sdk-2.9.0/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh", "&&",
                "west", "build", "--board", "BOARD", "--build-dir", "build",
                "${workspaceFolder}", "--",
                "-DNCS_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=NONE", "-DBOARD_ROOT=${workspaceFolder}"
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```
Replace BOARD with your specific board (e.g. `supermini_uf2/nrf52840` for the SuperMini, `nrf52840dongle/nrf52840` for a dongle receiver). <br>
The compiled firmware will be located at `PROJECT_DIR/build/PROJECT_DIR/zephyr/zephyr[.hex|.uf2]`.

### Flashing Boards with Adafruits UF2 Bootloader (SuperMini / XIAO)

#### Flashing the Bootloader
1. You can download them here: <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases">https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases</a>
1. For the SuperMini, download ```update-nice_nano_bootloader-x.x.x_nosd.uf2```. For the XIAO, download ```update-xiao_nrf52840_ble_sense_bootloader-x.x.x_nosd.uf2```. (The appropriate non-Sense version does not update the bootloader.)
1. Connect the device to your computer using a USB data cable.
1. The device should initially start in DFU mode when new and without a bootloader. The LED should fade on and off.
1. If the device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or briefly short the RST and GND pins) twice within 0.5 seconds. If the device has existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset it four times.
1. Navigate to your Downloads folder and copy the UF2 file.
1. Navigate to the Mass Storage Drive (ex. NICENANO/XIAO-SENSE) from ThisPC.
1. Paste the file there, and the window should close, causing the device to reboot.

```admonish important
Update the bootloader on your SuperMini and XIAO boards before flashing the firmware; otherwise, there is a significant risk of bricking your device. eByte and Nordic dongles are not included in this category.
```

#### Flashing the Firmware using UF2
1. Connect the device to your computer using a USB data cable.
1. The device should initially start in DFU mode when new and without a bootloader. The LED should fade on and off.
1. If the device's LED is not fading on and off, press the reset button twice (or briefly short the RST and GND pins) twice within 0.5 seconds. If the device has existing SlimeNRF firmware, reset it four times.
1. Navigate to your local Receiver or Tracker repository, then go to ```build\REPOSITORY_NAME\zephyr\```.
1. Copy zephyr.uf2 file.
1. Navigate to the Mass Storage Drive (ex. NICENANO/XIAO-SENSE) from ThisPC.
1. Paste the file there, and the window should close, causing the device to reboot.

#### Flashing the Firmware using adafruit-nrfutil
This uses the bootloaders serial protocol to flash it using command line tools. <br>
See <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil">Adafruit nRF52 nrfutil Github Repo</a> for install and usage instructions. <br>
Recommended: Use a python venv to install the adafruit-nrfutil python tool.

### Flashing Dongles with SoftDevice/Nordic Bootloader (eByte/Nordic)

This bootloader will appear as "Open DFU Bootloader" by Nordic Semiconductor. Currently, the only confirmed method for flashing firmware onto these devices is through <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop">nRF Connect for Desktop</a>, though it should also be possible to use <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Util">nRF Util</a> (but it is more complex and practically equivalent). <br>
NOTE: Installing the Segger J-Link is not required for this bootloader. <br>
NOTE: On Linux, nRF Connect for Desktop installs nodeJS tools into `~/.nrfconnect-apps/`, nRF Util installs binary tools into `~/.nrfutil/`.

#### Flashing using nRF Connect for Desktop
1. Open "Programmer" in the nRF Connect.
1. Press the reset button, and the LED should begin to fade on and off, placing the device in DFU Mode. For eByte dongle, this is the right button. For Nordic dongle, it is the side button (not the round white button).
1. In the top left corner, select your Device.
1. Click on "Add File".
1. Navigate to your local Receiver repository, then select the file located at ```build\REPOSITORY_NAME\zephyr\zephyr.hex```.
1. Click the "Write button".

#### Flashing using nRF Util
Not documented yet. Relevant documentation:
- <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-device/guides/programming.html">device command documentation</a>
- <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/guides-nrf5sdk/dfu_generating_packages.html">nrf5sdk pkg building guide</a>

### Firmware Setup

#### Accessing the Serial Console

You can interact with the firmware by connecting to the serial console it provides, which is used for pairing and calibration. <br>
The following examples will utilize nRF Connect for Desktop; however, you may choose from a wide variety of alternative tools. <br>
For example, by using the standard Linux `screen` utility, you can access the serial console as follows: <br>
`sudo screen /dev/ttyACMX 115200` <br>
You can determine which serial port to use by running `sudo dmesg` after connecting your nRF device. <br>
For Windows, there are similar tools available, such as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PuTTY</a> that you can use to <a href="https://documentation.help/PuTTY/using-serial.html">access a serial console</a>.

#### Pairing Mode

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** For trackers to appear on SlimeVR server for the first time it usually required to reboot receivers and trackers after pairing. 
Trackers appear in server list only after being moved.
```

## Troubleshooting
```admonish important
Please open a GitHub issue for any firmware bugs or issues in the corresponding repositories.
```

### Check Console Logs

1. Launch nRF Connect for Desktop.
1. Open the Serial Terminal in nRF Connect.
1. Ensure that your tracker is connected to your computer using a cable.
1. In the top left corner, select your tracker under Devices.
1. Click the "Connect to Port" button.

#### Improving Logging

- In order to change the log level you see (e.g., LOG_DBG instead of just LOG_INF), you may need to edit the `LOG_MODULE_REGISTER` macro at the top of the relevant module or file you are interested in and then recompile the firmware.<br>

- If you need to view the logs prior to connecting to the serial console, you may need to explicitly initiate the logging backend by adding the following code snippet in the main function of main.c:
    ``` C
    const struct log_backend *backend = log_backend_get_by_name("log_backend_uart");
    log_backend_enable(backend, backend->cb->ctx, CONFIG_LOG_MAX_LEVEL);
    ```
    Additionally, add the following include to the top of the main.c file: <br>
    ```C
    #include <zephyr/logging/log_ctrl.h>
    ```
- If you notice that the logs are truncated at a certain point, the buffer size may be insufficient. This issue has not been fully resolved yet, as simply increasing `CONFIG_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE` in `prj.conf` does not appear to be effective.

#### SWD Debugging
* Instructions for the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Pico, ST-Link V2, and other debuggers will be added in the future.
