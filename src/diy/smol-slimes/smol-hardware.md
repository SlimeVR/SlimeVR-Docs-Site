## üì° Receiver Hardware

It is essential to use boards equipped with high-quality antennas to ensure signal integrity and range. Hardware featuring PCB antennas is generally the best option for use as a receiver.

### USB Dongles
These dongles have a fairly optimized PCB antenna. If you have issues with signal integrity, it is recommended to use a USB extension cable.

### Microcontrollers Modified Into USB Dongles

```admonish note
If you plan to use microcontroller as receiver you can modify it to improve signal strength, replacing the built-in antenna with a 31.2 mm wire. This creates a basic monopole antenna.

## üèÉ Trackers
Before you start, decide on [how many trackers you may need](../slimevr101.md#how-many-trackers-do-you-need).

Trackers are required to have a battery and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). A magnetometer is optional.\
Buttons and slide switches are recommended but not required. Buttons can be added to control the tracker, and a slide switch can be used to physically disconnect a tracker's battery.

### üü© Sensor Modules with IMU and Magnetometer
```admonish warning
 Please note that the most common sensor modules are not supported.
```

Why combined?
- Reduces size.
- Simplifies integration.
- Ensures consistent alignment of all sensors.

##### Meia IMU + Magnetometer Modules
Meia produces and sells IMU's with an onboard magnetometer. These have form factor suitable for stacked builds. Meia, is a member of the SlimeVR Discord.

### üñ≤Ô∏è Buttons
Push buttons and momentary switches are utilized to control the tracker. The functions of this button‚ÄîReset, Calibration, Pairing, Deep Sleep, and entering DFU Mode‚Äîdepend on the number of press combinations. A tracker can be equipped with either a reset button, a user-specified (SW0) button, or both.

The reset button is designed to support all functionalities. If an user-specified button (SW0) is defined, it will be utilized instead.

If a button is unavailable, tweezers can be used to short the pins for the initial tracker setup.

### üïπÔ∏è Switches
A slide switch can be used to physically disconnect a battery. Some boards have a high standby power draw and will require a switch.

If a switch is not utilized, a tracker can enter Deep Sleep mode by pressing and holding down the user-specified button (SW0).

### üîã Batteries
Most boards support a 3.7V Li-ion or LiPo battery. Batteries are rated by their capacity (usually in mAh), and they also have a maximum safe charging rate‚Äîoften expressed as ‚ÄúC.‚Äù Charging at 1C means you‚Äôre using a current equal to the battery‚Äôs capacity. For example, a 1000mAh battery charged at 1A (which is 1C) should reach full charge in about one hour. However, charging at this maximum rate can stress the battery.

For longer battery life, it‚Äôs recommended to charge at a lower rate‚Äîaround 0.5C.\
This means, for a 1000mAh battery, using a 500mA charge current. Although this slower rate will take roughly two hours to fully charge the battery, it helps reduce wear and extends its lifespan.

| Board                      | Default charge rate | Minimum battery capacity | Recommended battery capacity |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 | 50mA                | 50mAh                    | 80-300mAh                    |
| SuperMini nRF52840         | 100mA               | 100mAh                   | 180-300mAh                   |
