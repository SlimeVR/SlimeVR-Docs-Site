# Firmware Setup

## Accessing the Serial Console

You can interact with the firmware by connecting to the serial console it provides, which is used for pairing and calibration. <br>
The following examples will utilize nRF Connect for Desktop; however, you may choose from a wide variety of alternative tools. <br>
For example, by using the standard Linux `screen` utility, you can access the serial console as follows: <br>
`sudo screen /dev/ttyACMX 115200` <br>
You can determine which serial port to use by running `sudo dmesg` after connecting your nRF device. <br>
For Windows, there are similar tools available, such as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">PuTTY</a> that you can use to <a href="https://documentation.help/PuTTY/using-serial.html">access a serial console</a>.

# Calibration

## Basic

### Method 1: Console

1. Launch nRF Connect for Desktop.
1. Open the Serial Terminal in nRF Connect.
1. Ensure that your tracker is connected to your computer using a cable.
1. In the top left corner, select your tracker under Devices.
1. Click the "Connect to Port" button.
1. Type ```calibrate``` into the console while the tracker is placed on a flat surface.
1. Wait for the logs to reboot and print out again.

### Method 2: Button
1. Press the Reset or SW0 (Functional) button twice, then place the tracker on a flat surface and allow it to remain still for a few seconds.

## 6-Sided
1. Ensure that the power switch is turned on so that the tracker can operate on battery power when unplugged.
1. Launch the nRF Connect for Desktop.
1. Open the Serial Terminal in nRF Connect.
1. Ensure that your tracker is connected to your computer using a cable.
1. In the top left corner, select your tracker under Devices.
1. Click the "Connect to Port" button.
1. Enter the ```6-side``` command in the console. (Currently, there is no button combination available to initiate this calibration.)
1. Follow the console log while rotating the sides on a flat surface. Leave the cable side for last.
1. When prompted for the final side, disconnect your USB cable and position the side with the USB port on a flat surface.
1. Wait a moment until the calibration is complete.

## Magnetometer
1. Please note that this calibration is passively active and does not require any command or button press combination to initiate.
1. Rotate your tracker 360 degrees on each of the six sides of the tracker while it is placed on a flat surface.

Note: The LED will blink when you place it flat on each side and will blink continuously when it is ready to save.

# Updating Firmware
