### Depact V2 Smol Strap

_Design by Depact_

<img src="assets/straps/straps-builds/Depact V2 Strap.webp" alt="strap image" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 300px"/>

#### Summary

Same bare bone and modular approach as V1, but needs needle and thread on top. Buckle recommended to replace with good 3D printed one.

**üëç Pros:**
- So bare bone, that any part can be replaced if needed.
- A little sewing required, with big tolerance for error.
- Minimal tools needed. Scissors and needle.

**üëé Cons:**
- May not be as convenient as straps with hook and loop.

#### Making Steps

1. Wrap band around tracker position.
2. Cut band slightly longer than needed to wrap around.
3. Put case and buckles on band.
4. Sew to band one of the buckle ends.
5. From remaining band, not used for straps, cut one piece per each strap with length slightly less than band width. This gives slight tightness fixating band on unsewn end of strap. 
   1. Wrap this piece around strap slightly tight, so it fixate unsewn end with buckle
