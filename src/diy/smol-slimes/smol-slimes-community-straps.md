As barebone and easy to build as things can get. The problem is that it not holds well together because not sewed.

Made with [Gremlin](./smol-slimes-community-builds.md) and [Ibis Trackers](./smol-slimes-community-builds.md) builds.

Pros:
+ No sewing.
+ Minimum entrance barrier. Only scissors needed to put together.

Cons:
- Not holds great.
