_Design by Depact_

<img src="assets/straps/strap-community-builds/Depact V1 Strap.webp" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 300px;width:100%"/>

#### Summary

As bare bones as things can be. It's recommended to replace the buckle with a good 3D-printed one.

**üëç Pros:**
- So bare bones that any part can be replaced if needed.
- No sewing required.
- The only tool needed is scissors.

**üëé Cons:**
- Straps may slide within the buckle.
- Attachment may be less secure.
- May not be as convenient as straps with hook and loop fasteners.

#### Making Steps

1. Wrap band around tracker position.
2. Cut the band slightly longer than needed to wrap fully around the placement.
3. Attach the case and buckles to the band.

#### Required Components

### Depact V2 Smol Strap

_Design by Depact_

<img src="assets/straps/strap-community-builds/Depact V2 Strap.webp"loading="lazy" style="max-width: 300px;width:100%"/>

#### Summary

Same bare bone and modular approach as V1, but needs needle and thread on top. Buckle recommended to replace with good 3D printed one.

**üëç Pros:**
- So bare bone, that any part can be replaced if needed.
- A little sewing required, with big tolerance for error.
- Minimal tools needed. Scissors and needle.

**üëé Cons:**
- May not be as convenient as straps with hook and loop.

#### Making Steps

1. Wrap band around tracker position.
2. Cut band slightly longer than needed to wrap around.
3. Put case and buckles on band.
4. Sew one end of the buckle to the band.
5. Now make loop keeper.
   1. From the remaining band material, that was not used for straps cut one piece per strap.
   <br/>
   Each piece should be slightly shorter than the band‚Äôs width three times. This adds slight tightness to help fix the unsewn end of the strap.
   2. Wrap this piece around the strap snugly to secure strap and unsewn strap tail that goes from unsewn buckle. Wrapping it snugly helps secure strap tail.
   3. Sew loop keeper avoiding to sew strap to it.
