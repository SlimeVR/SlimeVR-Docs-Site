This procedure will show how to prepare your system for uploading the firmware to your tracker.

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code

## 2. Install PlatformIO IDE

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, open it and install [PlatformIO IDE for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide), an extension that will allow you to connect to the tracker, build and upload the firmware.

## 3. Install Device Drivers

**Please note: these drivers will be automatically installed if you download and run the SlimeVR server.**

### For CH340 (NodeMCU v3, Wemos D1 Mini, and official SlimeVR trackers)

Download the `CH341SER.EXE` file from [here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/4/CH341SER.EXE), run it and follow installation instructions.

### For CP210X (NodeMCU v2)

1. Download the zip archive with the drivers from silicon labs [here](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip).

   For any other OS, the drivers can be found [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

1. Extract the files from the downloaded zip archive, then launch `CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe` (`CP210xVCPInstaller_x86.exe` if you are using 32-bit Windows) and follow installation instructions.

## 4. Install Git Client

For Windows, you can download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). If you have other OS, visit [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

_Note: you will most likely have to click "Click here to download manually". If that doesn't work, you can try [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)._

## 5. Clone the Firmware Project

Make sure you close any current projects you have open or open a new window before moving forward with these steps.

1. Click the **Source Control** button, click on **Clone Repository** and enter: `https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP.git`. If you're using experimental MPU+QMC5883L trackers, you would instead clone `https://github.com/deiteris/SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP.git`.

   If you installed git while Visual Studio Code was open you may have to close it and re-open it first.
