## SlimeVR FBT Server for Andorid Privacy Policy

The app does not collect or retain any of your personal information. However, it sends some information to other systems in order to minimally function. No data is ever sent outside of your local network without your explicit command to do so.


The following data may be sent to the server of your choice when you establish a connection:
* Information received from extrnal sensor connected to the app, such as SlimeVR Trackers;
* Acceleration and rotation of your phone;
* Your phone's local IP address and other data that is required to send and receive network packets;
* Any other data you input in the settings of the app.

Additionally, the app contains an Auto Discover feature that seeks to automatically find and discover compatible servers and devices on your local network. It periodically broadcasts UDP packets to your entire local network when the app is open. These packets contain your phone's local IP address and other data that is required to send and receive UDP packets.


This privacy policy does not govern the use of your data by the servers you connect to. The aforementioned data is hence subject to the privacy policy of compatible servers on your local network, or on another network if you choose to enter another network's IP address.
