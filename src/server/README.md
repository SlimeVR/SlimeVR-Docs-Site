# SlimeVR Setup

This guide should help you set up SlimeVR trackers and software.

The guide assumes you have either working and flashed DIY trackers, or
production trackers. If you are looking for information building your own
trackers please jump to our [DIY guide page](../diy/index.html), if you need to
flash your tracker's firmware check the [firmware guide](../firmware/index.html).

The follow pages assume you are working in a windows environment, if you are on
Linux check [our Linux page first](../tools/linux-installation.html).
