# SlimeVR Setup

This guide should help you set up SlimeVR trackers and software.

The guide assumes you have either working and flashed DIY trackers, or production trackers. If you are looking for information building your own trackers please jump to our [DIY guide page](../diy/index.html), if you need to flash your tracker's firmware check the [firmware guide](../firmware/index.html).

> PLEASE NOTE: The follow pages are out of date currently, if you are setting up your trackers for the first time please visit our [Quick Setup Guide](quick-setup.md).

The follow pages assume you are working in a windows environment, if you are on Linux check [our Linux page first](../tools/linux-installation.html).
