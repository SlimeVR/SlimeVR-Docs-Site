# Alternative Wi-Fi Options

## Windows Mobile Hotspot

You can set up a Wi-Fi hotspot through Windows using the Mobile Hotspot feature.

1. Navigate in Windows settings to [Settings > Network & internet > Mobile hotspot](ms-settings:network-mobilehotspot).
2. Under the "Properties" section, click Edit and set the name and password to whatever you want.
   - Ensure that the "Band" (aka "Network band") is set to 2.4 GHz for SlimeVR trackers. The hotspot can only be 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz and not both, so if it's set to "Any" or 5 GHz, then it will not support 2.4 GHz.
3. Once you have configured the network, you can toggle the "Mobile hotspot" on.
