_Design by Depact_

<img src="../assets/img/straps/strap-community-builds/Depact V1 Strap.webp" alt="strap image" loading="lazy" class="big-size-image"/>

#### Summary

This setup is extremely minimal. It's recommended to replace the buckle with a good 3D-printed one.

**üëç Pros:**
- So bare bones that any part can be replaced if needed.
- No sewing required.
- The only tool needed is scissors.

**üëé Cons:**
- Straps may slide within the buckle.
- Attachment may be less secure.
- May not be as convenient as straps with hook and loop fasteners.

#### Assembly Steps

1. Wrap band around tracker position.
2. Cut the band slightly longer than needed to wrap fully around the placement.
3. Attach the case and buckles to the band.

### Depact V2 Smol Strap

_Design by Depact_

<img src="../assets/img/straps/strap-community-builds/Depact V2 Strap.webp" loading="lazy" class="big-size-image"/>

#### Summary

Same bare bone and modular approach as V1, but needs needle and thread on top. Buckle recommended to replace with good 3D printed one.

**üëç Pros:**
- So bare-bones that any part can be replaced if needed.
- A little sewing is required, but there's a high tolerance for error.
- Minimal tools needed: scissors and a needle.

**üëé Cons:**
- May not be as convenient as straps with hook-and-loop fasteners.

#### Assembly Steps

1. Wrap band around tracker position.
2. Cut band slightly longer than needed to wrap around.
3. Put the case and the buckles on the band.
4. Sew one end of the buckle to the band.
5. Now make loop keeper.
   1. Cut one piece of band per strap, slightly shorter than three times the band's width, so the loop sits snugly when sewn.
   2. Wrap this piece snugly around the strap to secure both the strap and the loose tail extending from the unsewn buckle.
   3. Sew the loop keeper, being careful not to sew it to the strap.

Note: 5 meters of band was enough for 7 straps for average european XL sized man.
