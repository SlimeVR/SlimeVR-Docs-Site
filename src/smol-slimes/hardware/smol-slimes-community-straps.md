_Design by Depact_

<p>

</p>

**Summary**

V3 extends on V2, but significantly reduce sliding when dancing and mowing.

**👍 Pros:**
- No sewing needed
- Modular: any part can be replaced
- Minimal tools needed: just scissors

**👎 Cons:**
- 3D printing is required

**Notes**
- Make straps one by one, to get a handle over right length
- Dovetail design was chosen as one of highest ranked in buckle ranking at the time of making, and can be replaced
- You can cauterize (melt) the raw edges with a lighter to seal the fibers. Band by the link is tested to cauterize, but ensure you not create fire hazard

**Assembly Steps**

1. Wrap the band **snug, not tight** around each [spot of tracker placement](../../diy/diy-strap-components.md#tracker-placement). 
</br>Keep the band flat and level.
</br>Add 10 cm to each measurement. You can always cut down, but you need to leave enough to be able to adjust.
1. Cut band.
2. Put the case, slides and buckles on the band.
3. Sew one end of the buckle to the band.

##### 🚫 Depact Smol Strap V2 

_Design by Depact_

```admonish warning
<b>Reason Not Recommended:</b> Obsoleted by replacement of buckles and loop keepers in V3.
```

<img src="./assets/img/strap-community-builds/Depact V2 Strap.webp" loading="lazy" class="big-size-image" alt="Depact V2 Strap"/>

**Summary**

Same bare-bones and modular approach as V1, but it also requires a needle and thread. It’s recommended to replace the buckle with a good 3D-printed one.

**👍 Pros:**
- So bare-bones that any part can be replaced if needed.
- Minimal tools needed: just scissors and a needle.

**👎 Cons:**
- May not be as convenient as straps with hook-and-loop fasteners.

**Assembly Steps**

1. Wrap band around tracker position.
2. Cut band slightly longer than needed to wrap around.
3. Put the case and the buckles on the band.
4. Sew one end of the buckle to the band.
5. Now, make the loop keeper.
   1. Cut one piece of band per strap, slightly shorter than three times the strap’s width, so the loop sits snugly when sewn.
   2. Wrap this piece snugly around the strap to secure both the strap and the loose tail extending from the unsewn buckle.
   3. Sew the loop keeper, being careful not to sew it to the strap.

**Required Components**

5 meters of elastic band are generally enough to make 6 straps for an average man wearing European size XL.
