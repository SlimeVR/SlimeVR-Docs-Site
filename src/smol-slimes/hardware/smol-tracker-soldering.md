### Depact Smol Tracker Soldering Text Tutorial

#### Tools Needed

##### Essential Tools
- Side cutter pliers
- Tweezers (used for holding buttons and header pins in place)
- Soldering iron
- Soldering sponge (used for cleaning the soldering iron tip)
- Flux-cored solder wire (recommended for ease of use over separate solder and flux)
- Scissors (used for cutting Kapton tape)

##### Optional Additional Tools

- Soldering jig (optional, but makes holding the board easier)
- Soldering mat (optional, protects your workspace)

#### Soldering Steps

1. **Solder the Button**
   - Prefill the through-holes under the button contacts with solder.
   - Place the button onto the solder-filled holes.
   - Heat the area with the soldering iron until the solder connects the button pads securely.

2. **Solder the Breakaway Header**
   - Break off a segment of 6 pins from the breakaway header strip.
   - Insert the header into the through-holes, leaning it slightly toward the center of the board to hold it in place.
   - Solder each pin one by one, making sure they remain straight and securely attached.

3. **Insulate the IMU**
   - Cover the backs of the IMU with Kapton tape to prevent shorts.

4. **Solder Headers to the IMU**
   - Solder a row of breakaway headers to one side of the IMU.

   - Solder the headers on the other side at a slight angle to ensure contact with the IMU pads.

5. **Trim and Inspect Header Pins**
   - Use side cutter pliers to trim excess length from the header pins.
   - Inspect the solder joints and add more solder if needed, but avoid overheating, as this can loosen the pins.

6. **Solder the Antenna Mod and Battery**
   - Solder the antenna wire and the battery leads to their respective pads.
   - For the antenna, cut a wire approximately the length of the board—just make sure it is at least 31.2 mm long.

Double-check each connection carefully before powering the board.

Use the `info` command in a serial terminal to check if the IMU is detected. If it is not detected, this usually means there is a soldering issue, or less commonly, a hardware fault.
