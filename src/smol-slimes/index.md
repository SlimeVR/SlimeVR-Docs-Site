# Smol Slime
Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, use a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB), on Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. These trackers are highly power-efficient and require only a small battery, often lasting for days or even weeksâ€”significantly longer than traditional ESP (WiFi-based) SlimeVR trackers. A receiver (or dongle) is needed to bridge communication between the trackers and the SlimeVR Server. This setup does not work with standalone Quest headsets unless OSC (Open Sound Control) is used via a connected computer.

## ðŸ¦‹ Introducing the Butterfly Tracker â€“ SlimeVR's Official Smol Tracker
Looking for something simpler than building your own? The Butterfly Tracker is SlimeVRâ€™s official take on the Smol Slimeâ€”ultra-thin, lightweight, and ready to use out of the box.

## Getting Started

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of the SlimeVR Server and could require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final at this stage, including hardware, firmware, and communication protocols.
