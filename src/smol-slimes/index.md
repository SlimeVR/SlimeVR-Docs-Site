# Smol Slime
Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, use a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductorâ€™s nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. These trackers are highly power-efficient and can run for days or even weeks on a small batteryâ€”significantly longer than traditional ESP (WiFi-based) SlimeVR trackers.

A receiver (or dongle) is required to bridge communication between the trackers and the SlimeVR Server. The receiver can be connected to a computer for PCVR, or used with Quest standalone headsets through OSC (Open Sound Control).

Receivers can also be plugged directly into a Quest headset or Android device for fully standalone tracking. In these setups, SlimeVR Server v0.16.3 or later is required, and an OTG adapter may also be needed. OSC is always required for Quest standalone setups, whether the receiver is connected to a computer, another Android device, or the headset itself.

## Getting Started

```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of the SlimeVR Server and could require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final at this stage, including hardware, firmware, and communication protocols.
