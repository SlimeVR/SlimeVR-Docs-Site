# Smol Slime
```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of the SlimeVR Server and could require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final at this stage, including hardware, firmware, and communication protocols.
```

Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, use a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB), on Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. These trackers are highly power-efficient and require only a small battery, often lasting for days or even weeks—significantly longer than traditional ESP (WiFi-based) SlimeVR trackers. A receiver (or dongle) is needed to bridge communication between the trackers and the SlimeVR Server. This setup does not work with standalone Quest headsets unless OSC (Open Sound Control) is used via a connected computer.

## Getting Started

- **[Community Builds](community/smol-slimes-community-builds.md)**
  Examples of completed builds, cases, and lists of components you will need to create your own set of matching trackers.

- **[Hardware](hardware/index.md)**
  Guides on hardware used for trackers and receiver, schematics for assembly, and cost calculator for planning out your project.

- **[Firmware](firmware/index.md)**
  Guides on using pre-compiled firmware, configuring and compiling your own firmware, and flashing firmware for your devices.

- **[Pairing & Calibration](firmware/smol-pairing-and-calibration.md)**
  Guides on pairing your trackers to your receiver, performing various calibrations for your trackers, lists of console commands, and button press functions.
