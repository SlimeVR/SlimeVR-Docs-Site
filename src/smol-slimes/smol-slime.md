# Smol Slime
```admonish warning
**Disclaimer:** This project is highly experimental. These devices may be incompatible with newer versions of the SlimeVR Server and may require frequent firmware updates. Nothing is final at this stage, including hardware, firmware, and communication protocols.
```

Smol Slimes, also known as nRF Trackers, use a protocol called Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) on Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 and nRF54L series System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. These trackers are highly power-efficient and require only a small battery, often lasting for days or even weeks—significantly longer than traditional ESP (WiFi-based) SlimeVR trackers. A receiver (or dongle) is needed to bridge communication between the trackers and the SlimeVR Server. Note: This setup does not work with standalone Quest headsets unless you use a computer with OSC (Open Sound Control).

```admonish note
Welcome, traveler. If you're new, check out the [Smol Community Builds](community/smol-slimes-community-builds.md) for completed project examples and suggested parts.

You can explore [Smol Receiver](hardware/smol-receiver.md) and [Smol Tracker](hardware/smol-tracker.md) to learn more.

Community designs will usually work with a pre-built firmware.
- You can find pre-built firmware in the [Pre-Compiled Firmware](firmware/smol-pre-compiled-firmware.md) section.
- To build the firmware yourself, see [Compiling Firmware](firmware/smol-compiling-firmware.md).

Once you’ve flashed the firmware, you’ll need to set up and calibrate it—see [Smol Pairing & Calibration](firmware/smol-pairing-and-calibration.md).
