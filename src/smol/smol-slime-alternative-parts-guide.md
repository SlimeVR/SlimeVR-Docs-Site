## üì° Receiver
This chapter provides a list of compatible receiver alternatives and microcontrollers that can be modified for use as receivers.\
It is important to use boards with a good antenna to maintain signal integrity and range. Hardware with PCB antennas are generally the best option to use as a receiver.\
These boards use antenna designs that are not optimized for range. If you are using the same boards for both trackers and receiver, they will likely perform poorly without modification.


### USB Dongles
These dongles have a fairly optimized PCB antenna. If you have issues with signal integrity, it is recommended to use a USB extension cable.

### Microcontrollers Modified Into USB Dongles
If you want to improve signal strength, you can replace the built-in antenna with a 31 mm wire. This creates a basic monopole antenna.

## üèÉ Trackers
Before you start, decide on [how many trackers you may need](../slimevr101.md#how-many-trackers-do-you-need).

Trackers are required to have a battery and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). A magnetometer is optional.\
Buttons and slide switches are recommended but not required. Buttons can be added to control the tracker, and a slide switch can be used to physically disconnect a tracker's battery.

### Sensor Modules

#### IMU Modules
Some of the supported sensor modules are described on the [IMU Comparison page](../diy/imu-comparison.md). Note that most common sensor modules are not supported.

#### IMU + Magnetometer Modules
Meia, a member of the [SlimeVR Discord](#discord), produces and sells sensor modules with an onboard magnetometer. They are compatible with common sensor modules, and the form factor is suitable for stacked builds.

### Buttons
Push buttons/momentary switches are used to control the tracker. Multiple button configurations are supported. A tracker can have either a reset button, a user button, or both.

The reset button is suitable for all functionality. If a user button is available, it will be used instead.

If a button is not available, tweezers can be used to short the pins for initial tracker setup.

### Switches
A slide switch can be used to physically disconnect a battery. Some boards have a high standby power draw and will require a switch.

If a switch is not used, a tracker can enter deep sleep by holding down the user button.

### Batteries
Most boards will support a 3.7V Li-ion/LiPo battery. Usually, batteries have a maximum charge rate of 1C, or a 1 hour charge rate. Do not use a battery if the charge rating will be exceeded.

To extend the lifespan of the battery, a much lower charge rate close to 0.5C is recommended.
