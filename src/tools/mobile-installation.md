# Mobile Setup

There are a couple options for using SlimeVR natively on mobile devices instead of on a PC. This guide will help you set up the SlimeVR server on a mobile device.

## Android

### Requirements

- Android 8.0+ (Oreo)
- Port 8080 is free
- App is set to run in the background (<https://dontkillmyapp.com/>)

### Installation

Download [SlimeVR-android.apk](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Server/releases/latest/download/SlimeVR-android.apk) from the latest SlimeVR release and install it on Android. You may need to enable installing from unknown sources, generally your phone will prompt you for this.

#### Quest setup

**This setup is not recommended as the Quest OS is buggy with the SlimeVR app.** This method should only be used as a last resort; running the app on a phone or PC (even if it isn't powerful enough for VR) will be a significantly better experience.
